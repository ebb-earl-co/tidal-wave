# tidal-wave &#x1F3B6; &#x1F30A;
Waving at the [TIDAL](https://tidal.com) music service with [Python](https://www.python.org/). Runs on (at least) Windows, macOS, and GNU/Linux.

>  TIDAL is an artist-first, fan-centered music streaming platform that delivers over 100 million songs in HiFi sound quality to the global music community. © 2024 TIDAL Music AS

This project is inspired by [`qobuz-dl`](https://github.com/vitiko98/qobuz-dl), and, particularly, is a continuation of [`Tidal-Media-Downloader`](https://github.com/yaronzz/Tidal-Media-Downloader). **This project is intended for private use only: it is not intended for distribution of copyrighted content**.

This software uses libraries from the [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org) project under the [LGPLv2.1](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html). FFmpeg is a trademark of [Fabrice Bellard](http://www.bellard.org/), originator of the FFmpeg project. 

## Features
* Retrieve [FLAC](https://xiph.org/flac/), [Dolby Atmos](https://www.dolby.com/technologies/dolby-atmos/), [Sony 360 Reality Audio](https://electronics.sony.com/360-reality-audio), or [AAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding) tracks; [AVC/H.264](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding) (up to 1920x1080) + [AAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding) videos
* Either a single track or an entire album can be retrieved
* Album covers are retrieved by default, and embedded into all tracks
  - Highest-resolution, "original" album covers, which can be up to 6000x6000 pixels resolution, are retrieved if available
* Support for albums with multiple discs
* If available, lyrics are added as metadata to tracks
* If available, album reviews are retrieved as JSON
* If available, album credits are retrieved as JSON
* If available, artist bios are retrieved as JSON
* If available, artist images are retrieved as JPEG
* Playlist retrieval support (video or audio or both)
* Playlist .m3u8 file automatically created
* Mix retrieval support (video or audio)
* Artist's entire works retrieval support (video and audio; albums or albums and EPs and singles)
* Because of the use of the `requests` package, system proxies are respected (HTTP, HTTPs, Socks); or can be specified by typical environment variable
* Also because of the use of `requests`, very simple [`Cache-Control`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) request caching occurs via `CacheControl`
* If desired, all JSON responses from the TIDAL API can be saved for inspection or posterity or debugging

## Getting Started
A current, valid TIDAL subscription is required in order to run `tidal-wave`. Previously, TIDAL segmented the available audio qualities into HiFi and HiFi Plus plans: now, 
> All current TIDAL plans feature Max sound quality formats such as full lossless, HiRes FLAC, and Dolby Atmos (up to 24-bit, 192 kHz).

More information on sound quality at [TIDAL's site here](https://tidal.com/sound-quality).

### Requirements
 - As resources will be fetched from the World Wide Web, an Internet connection is required
 - The venerable [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/download.html) is necessary for audio and video data manipulation. This project's [container image](https://github.com/ebb-earl-co/tidal-wave/blob/trunk/Dockerfile) as well as its [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/)-created [binaries](https://github.com/ebb-earl-co/tidal-wave/releases/latest) build FFmpeg from source, so separate installation is unnecessary.
   - Static builds of FFmpeg are available from [John Van Sickle](https://www.johnvansickle.com/ffmpeg/) for GNU/Linux, or most package managers feature `ffmpeg`.
   - For macOS, the [FFmpeg download page](http://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-mac) links to [this download source](https://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/); or there is always [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ffmpeg)
   - For Windows, the [FFmpeg download page](http://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows) lists 2 resources; or [`chocolatey`](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ffmpeg) is an option
   - If a minimal FFmpeg, compiled from source, is desired, take a look at this project's [BUILDME.md](https://github.com/ebb-earl-co/tidal-wave/blob/trunk/BUILDME.md) file for decent instructions
 - This is a Python package, so **to use it in the default manner** you will need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), version 3.8 or newer, on your system.
   - *However*, as of December 2023, an [OCI container image](https://github.com/ebb-earl-co/tidal-wave/pkgs/container/tidal-wave); and [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/)-created binaries for x86\_64 GNU/Linux, Apple Silicon macOS, x86\_64 macOS, and x86\_64 Windows are provided for download and use that *do not require Python to be installed*
 - Only a handful of Python libraries are dependencies:
   - [`backoff`](https://pypi.org/project/backoff/)
   - [`cachecontrol`](https://pypi.org/project/CacheControl/)
   - [`dataclass-wizard`](https://pypi.org/project/dataclass-wizard/)
   - [`ffmpeg-python`](https://pypi.org/project/ffmpeg-python/)
   - [`mutagen`](https://pypi.org/project/mutagen/)
   - [`m3u8`](https://pypi.org/project/m3u8/)
   - [`platformdirs`](https://pypi.org/project/platformdirs/)
   - [`pycryptodome`](https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodome/)
   - [`requests[socks]`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
   - [`typer`](https://pypi.org/project/typer/)

### Docker
Pull the image from GitHub container repo:
```bash
$ docker pull ghcr.io/ebb-earl-co/tidal-wave:latest
# Or, the main branch of this repository, which will be ahead of `latest`:
$ docker pull ghcr.io/ebb-earl-co/tidal-wave:trunk
```
## Quickstart
If your Python installation's location is available on path, run `tidal-wave --help` to see the options available. Otherwise (including if you followed the repository cloning steps above), run `python3 -m tidal_wave --help` from the repository root directory, `tidal-wave`. In either case, you should see something like the following:
```bash

## Usage
Invocation of this tool will store credentials in a particular directory in the user's "home" directory: for Unix-like systems, this will be `/home/${USER}/.config/tidal-wave`: for Windows, it varies: in either OS situation, the exact directory is determined by the `user_config_path()` function of the `platformdirs` package.

Similarly, by default, all media retrieved is placed in subdirectories of the user's default music directory: for Unix-like systems, this probably is `/home/${USER}/Music`; for Windows it is probably `C:\Users\<USER>\Music`. This directory is determined by [`platformdirs.user_music_path()`](https://github.com/platformdirs/platformdirs?tab=readme-ov-file#platformdirs-to-the-rescue). 
 - If a different path is passed to the second CLI argument, `output_directory`, then all media is written to subdirectories of that directory.

:large_blue_diamond: This is the default client for `tidal-wave`, a spoofed Amazon Fire TV. It is the one invoked in all situations unless `--audio-format hires` or `--audio-format 360` is passed as a command line flag:
```bash
$ tidal-wave https://listen.tidal.com/album/000000
$ # no --audio-format flag passed will instruct tidal-wave to use the Fire TV client, as it implies --audio-format lossless
$ tidal-wave https://listen.tidal.com/album/000000 --audio-format high
$ # specifying low, high, lossless, or atmos will instruct tidal-wave to use the Fire TV client
$ tidal-wave https://listen.tidal.com/album/000000 --audio-format hires
$ # the above forces tidal-wave to ask for an access token gleaned from an Android, macOS, or Windows device, as laid out in the above table
```
Otherwise, in order to retrieve the desired audio format for a given track, it is **necessary** to have the access token from a compatible device; e.g. an Android device in order to retrieve Sony 360 Reality Audio tracks

### Version
It is certainly useful for debugging, and, perhaps, using multiple versions of a software, to know which binary/package invoked is which version. From version 2024.7.1 of `tidal-wave`, this is possible by adding the `--version` flag to any command. This is an _eager_ command, in `typer` parlance, meaning that **any** other flag or argument passed to `tidal-wave` will be ignored and the version will simply be returned. E.g.
```bash
$ tidal-wave --version
tidal-wave 2024.7.1
```
### Example
 - First, find the URL of the album/artist/mix/playlist/track/video desired. Then, simply pass it as the first argument to `tidal-wave` with no other arguments in order to: *retrieve the album/artist/mix/playlist/track in Lossless quality to a subdirectory of user's music directory and INFO-level logging* in the case of audio; *retrieve the video in 1080p, H.264+AAC quality to a subdirectory of user's music directory with INFO-level logging* in the case of a video URL.
 ```bash
 (.venv) $ tidal-wave https://tidal.com/browse/track/226092704
 ```
 - By default, the track(s) and/or video(s) are retrieved, and other files are retrieved as well; such as the artist's bio JSON, the artist's TIDAL image, the playlist's .m3u8 file, the album's review JSON, and a few others. In order **not to retrieve any of those**, pass the `--no-extra-files` flag:
 ```bash
 (.venv) $ tidal-wave https://tidal.com/browse/track/226092704 --no-extra-files
 ```
 - To (attempt to) get a Dolby Atmos track, and you desire to see *all* of the log output, the following will do that
 ```bash
 (.venv) $ tidal-wave https://tidal.com/browse/track/... --audio-format atmos --loglevel debug
 ```
 **Keep in mind that an access token from an Android (preferred), Windows, or macOS device will need to be extracted and passed to this tool in order to access HiRes FLAC or Sony 360 Reality Audio tracks**
 - To (attempt to) get a HiRes FLAC version of an album, and you desire to see only warnings and errors, the following will do that:
 ```bash
 $ tidal-wave https://tidal.com/browse/album/... --audio-format hires --loglevel warning
 ```

 - To (attempt to) get a playlist, the following will do that. **N.b.** passing anything to `--audio-format` is a no-op when retrieving videos.
 ```powershell
 PS > C:\Users\User > & tidal-wave_py311_pyapp.exe https://tidal.com/browse/playlist/...
 ```

 - To (attempt to) get a mix, the following will do that. **N.b.** passing anything to `--audio-format` is a no-op when retrieving videos.
 ```bash
 $ ./tidal-wave_py311.pyapp https://tidal.com/browse/mix/...
 ```

 - To (attempt to) get all of an artist's works (albums and videos, **excluding EPs and singles**) in Sony 360 Reality Audio format and verbose logging, the following will do that:
 ```bash
 (.venv) $ python3 -m tidal_wave https://listen.tidal.com/artist/... --audio-format 360 --loglevel debug
 ```

 - To (attempt to) get all of an artist's works (**including EPs and singles**), in HiRes format, the following will do that:
 ```bash
 (.venv) $ tidal-wave https://listen.tidal.com/artist/... --audio-format hires --include-eps-singles
 ```

 - As a throw-everything-at-the-wall-and-see-what-sticks option, there is the `--transparent` flag. In the directory where `tidal-wave` is called, `--transparent` will write the responses from the TIDAL API to .json files
 ```bash
 (.venv) $ tidal-wave https://listen.tidal.com/track/... --audio-format low  --loglevel debug --transparent
 ```

#### Playlists and Mixes
By default, when passed a playlist or mix URL, `tidal-wave` will retrieve all of the tracks and/or videos specified by that URL, and write them to a subdirectory of either `Playlists` or `Mixes`, which itself is a subdirectory of the specified `output_directory`. E.g. `~/Music/Mixes/My Daily Discovery [016dccd302e9ac6132d8334cfbc022]`. In this directory, once all of the tracks and/or videos have been retrieved, they are renamed based on the order in which they appear in the playlist. E.g.
```bash
(.venv) $ tidal-wave https://listen.tidal.com/playlist/1b418bb8-90a7-4f87-901d-707993838346

$ ls ~/Music/Playlists/New Arrivals [1b418bb8-90a7-4f87-901d-707993838346]/
'001 - Dance Alone [CD].flac'
'002 - Kissing Strangers [CD].flac'
'003 - Sunday Service [CD].flac'
```
If this is not the desired behavior, pass the `--no-flatten` flag. This flag instructs `tidal-wave` to leave the tracks and/or videos in the directory where they would have been written if they had been passed to `tidal-wave` independently. E.g.
```bash
(.venv) $ tidal-wave https://listen.tidal.com/playlist/1b418bb8-90a7-4f87-901d-707993838346 --no-flatten

$ ls ~/Music/
'Sia/Dance Alone [343225498] [2024]/01 - Dance Alone [CD].flac'
'USHER/COMING HOME [339249017] [2024]/05 - Kissing Strangers [CD].flac'
'Latto/Sunday Service [344275657] [2024]/01 - Sunday Service [CD].flac'
```

#### Docker example
The command line options are the same for the Python invocation, but in order to save configuration and audio data, volumes need to be passed. If they are bind mounts to directories, **they must be created before executing `docker run` to avoid permissions issues**! For example,
```bash
$ mkdir -p ./Music/ ./config/tidal-wave/
$ docker run \
    --rm -it \
    --name tidal-wave \
    --volume ./Music:/home/debian/Music \
    --volume ./config/tidal-wave:/home/debian/.config/tidal-wave \
    ghcr.io/ebb-earl-co/tidal-wave:latest \
    https://tidal.com/browse/track/...
```

Using Docker might be an attractive idea in the event that you want to retrieve all of the videos, albums, EPs, and singles in highest quality possible for a given artist. The following Docker invocation will do that for you:
```bash
$ mkdir -p ./Music/ ./config/tidal-wave/
$ docker run \
    --name tidal-wave \
    --rm -it \
    --volume ./Music:/home/debian/Music \
    --volume ./config/tidal-wave:/home/debian/.config/tidal-wave \
    ghcr.io/ebb-earl-co/tidal-wave:latest \
    https://listen.tidal.com/artist/... \
    --audio-format hires \
    --include-eps-singles
```

Perhaps you don't want a single-shot executable type of Docker invocation, but rather a long-lived container into which one can `docker exec` in order to request media at one's leisure. This is one of the requested features from the GitHub Discussions, in particular for Unraid users. In order to do this, use the following, slightly-modified Docker command:
```bash
$ mkdir -p ./Music/ ./config/tidal-wave/
$ docker run \
    --name tidal-wave \
    -dit \  # is short for: --detach --interactive --tty
    --volume ./Music:/home/debian/Music \
    --volume ./config/tidal-wave:/home/debian/.config/tidal-wave \
    --entrypoint "/bin/bash" \
    ghcr.io/ebb-earl-co/tidal-wave:latest
$ docker exec -it tidal-wave tidal-wave https://tidal.com/browse/album/...
$ docker exec -it tidal-wave tidal-wave https://tidal.com/browse/mix/...
$ docker exec -it tidal-wave tidal-wave https://tidal.com/browse/playlist/...
$ docker exec -it tidal-wave tidal-wave https://tidal.com/browse/track/...
```
Note: the first `tidal-wave` is whatever `--name` you give the container, so that can be whatever your heart desires, but the second `tidal-wave` is invoking the Python program *inside* the container and needs to exactly `tidal-wave`.
## Development
The easiest way to start working on development is to fork this project on GitHub, or clone the repository to your local machine and do the pull requesting on GitHub later. In any case, there will need to be some getting from GitHub first, so, roughly, the process is:
  1. Get Python 3.8+ on your system
  2. Use a virtualenv or some other Python environment system (poetry, pipenv, etc.)
  3. Clone the repository: `$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ebb-earl-co/tidal-wave/git`

    * Obviously replace the URL with your forked version if you've followed that strategy
  4. Activate the virtual environment and install the required packages (requirements.txt): `(some-virtual-env) $ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

    * optional packages to follow the coding style and build process; `pyinstaller`, `black`: `(some-virtual-env) $ python3 -m pip install black pyinstaller`
    * optionally, Rust and cargo in order to build the `pyapp` artifacts
    * optionally, Docker to build the OCI container artifacts
  5. From a Python REPL (or, my preferred method, an iPython session), import all the relevant modules, or the targeted ones for development:
  ```python
  from tidal_wave import album, artist, dash, hls, login, main, media, mix, models, oauth, playlist, requesting, track, utils, video
  from tidal_wave.main import logging, user_music_path, Path
  ```
